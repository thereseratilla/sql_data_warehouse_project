# SQL Data Warehouse Project

Welcome to my **first Data Warehouse Project**!

In this project, I created a modern data warehouse using SQL server. The Medallion Architecture is the approach used to build the data warehouse. Three layers are created, i.e., Bronze, Silver and Gold.

## Project requirements

### Building the Data Warehouse

### Objectives

Building a data warehouse with SQL server (including ETL, data modeling and analytics) to consolidate sales data, enabling analytical reporting and informed decision-making.

### Specifications
- **Data Sources**: Data are from two (2) sources: ERP and CRM systems in CSV format.
- **Data Quality**: Clean and transform data to ensure data quality prior to analysis
- **Integration**: Data from both sources will be consolidated to optimize analytical queries.
- **Scope**: Latest dataset only, no historization of data.
- **Documentation**: Clear documentation of the data model to support the analytics team and business stakeholders.

### Special Mention:

This project is made possible through **Data with Baraa**. Baraa is the best and the most underrated SQL instructor I have ever followed. His courses surpass the paid MOOCs that are available (which I am currently enrolled at). The best thing is that his courses are FREE on Youtube.
